# node-red-flows
Selection of node-red flows that I use when building rapid prototypes for IoT use cases.  Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its node.js runtime in a single-click.
